# Multiplier verification with UVM
 The aim of this lab is to verify a multiplier resorting to the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)

- Tutorial: UVM verification of a simple system verilog adder
- Point 2: Added constraints on tutorial UVM files and adder parallelism extension. 
- Point 3: Verification of the MBE Multiplier realized in LAB2 
- Point 4: Verification of the Floating Point multiplier realized in LAB2
